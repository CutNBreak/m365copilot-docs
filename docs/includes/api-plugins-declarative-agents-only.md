> [!IMPORTANT]
> API plugins are currently only supported as actions within [declarative agents](../overview-declarative-agent.md). They are not enabled in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. See [Add a plugin](../build-declarative-agents.md#add-a-plugin) for an example of adding an API plugin to a declarative agent.
