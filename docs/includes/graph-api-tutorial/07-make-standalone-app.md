Now that your agent is up and running to help users with complex tasks, you can give it a UI and host it so that you can access it in a browser similar to ChatGPT. You'll use the Chainlit Python package to do this.

1. Open a command prompt and go to the folder that contains **ClippywithUI.py**.
2. Run the following command: `Chainlit run ClippywithUI.py -w`.
3. Your agent will open in a browser and you should be able to ask it questions.
