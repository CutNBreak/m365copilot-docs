> - API plugins are currently only supported within [declarative copilots](../overview-declarative-copilot.md). They are not enabled in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. See [Add a plugin](../ttk-declarative-copilot-getting-started.md#add-a-plugin) for an example of adding an API plugin to a declarative copilot.
> - The capability is enabled by default in all Microsoft 365 Copilot licensed tenants. Admins can disable this functionality on a user and group basis and control how individual plugins are approved for use, and which plugins are enabled. For details see: [Manage Plugins for Copilot in Integrated Apps](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context).
