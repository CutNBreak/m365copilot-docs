> - API plugins are currently only supported as actions within [declarative agents](../overview-declarative-agent.md). They are not enabled in Microsoft 365 Copilot. See [Add a plugin](../build-declarative-agents.md#add-a-plugin) for an example of adding an API plugin to a declarative agent.
> - The capability is enabled by default in all Microsoft 365 Copilot licensed tenants. Admins can disable this functionality on a user and group basis and control how individual plugins are approved for use, and which plugins are enabled. For more information, see: [Manage Plugins for Copilot in Integrated Apps](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context).
