> [!IMPORTANT]
> API plugins are currently only supported within [declarative copilots](overview-declarative-copilot.md). They are not enabled in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. See [Add a plugin](../ttk-declarative-copilot-getting-started.md#add-a-plugin) for an example of adding an API plugin to a declarative copilot.
