> - Custom engine agents are conversational Teams bots with a custom LLM. They don't require a Microsoft 365 Copilot license to build, debug and deploy. However, custom engine agents are only available to licensed Microsoft 365 Copilot users or users in tenants that allow metered usage of agents.
> - The cost of a custom engine agent depends on the Azure services consumed in the app. To estimate the cost, visit the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).
