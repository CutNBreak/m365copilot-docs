# Manage extensions for Copilot for Microsoft 365

This article describes the different types of admin controls for managing Copilot extensions. Extensions for Microsoft 365 Copilot are packaged, distributed, and managed in the same way as other apps that run across the integrated Microsoft 365 platform. At its core, the integrated Microsoft 365 app platform extends the Teams app platform to provide a [unified app model](extensions-are-apps.md) for extensibility within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. App management controls for Microsoft 365 are also converging to the centralized Microsoft admin center. However, some controls are still accessible only from Teams admin center.

The following table summarizes management tools for Copilot extensibility scenarios, according to  distribution scenarios.

| Method of building Copilot extension | Published to AppSource (Store) | Published to organization | Uploaded for personal use|
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
|[Teams Toolkit](#manage-extensions-built-with-teams-toolkit) | Microsoft admin center | Microsoft admin center| Teams admin center|
|[Copilot Studio](#manage-extensions-built-with-copilot-studio)| Microsoft admin center| Power Platform admin center, Microsoft admin center | Power Platform admin center, Teams admin center|

## Manage extensions published to AppSource

Copilot extensions that are published to the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace (AppSource) and acquired from the in-product store are centrally managed from the **Integrated Apps** section of Microsoft admin center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)). This is the case regardless of how the extension was builtâ€”with Copilot Studio, Teams Toolkit, or another IDE. From a *Global Admin* or *Azure Application Admin* role, you can deploy/pre-install apps, manage how users can install and use apps, customize default settings, and remove apps.

## Manage extensions built with Teams Toolkit and other IDEs

### Extensions published to your organization

Microsoft 365 apps, including Copilot extensions, that are published to your organization or for personal use are called *Custom apps*. Custom apps that are published to your organization are centrally managed from the [**Integrated Apps**](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context) section of Microsoft admin center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)), just like third-party apps acquired from the store. The only difference is that end-users will see these custom, line-of-business apps and extensions labeled with **Built for your org** in the in-product app store.

As an admin, you can upload Copilot extensions and deploy them to to your organization from Microsoft admin center. For details, see [Upload custom Teams apps that work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#upload-custom-teams-apps-that-work-on-outlook-and-the-microsoft-365-app). 

### Extensions uploaded for personal use

Once packaged as Microsoft 365 apps, Copilot extensions can be uploaded (or *sideloaded*) by non-admins for personal use, such as for testing during the development process. Users can upload app packages directly from Teams Toolkit (Lifecycle > **Provision**), and also from Teams Toolkit CLI (`teamsapp install`) or Teams client (Manage your apps > Upload an app > **Upload a custom app**).

As an admin, you can control which users have permissions to upload apps for personal use. From Teams admin center,
