# Manage extensions for Copilot for Microsoft 365

Extensions for Microsoft 365 Copilot are packaged, distributed, and managed in the same way as other apps that run across the integrated Microsoft 365 platform. At its core, the integrated Microsoft 365 app platform extends the Teams app platform to provide a [unified app model](extensions-are-apps.md) for extensibility within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. 

App management controls for Microsoft 365 are also converging to the centralized Microsoft Admin Center. However, some controls are still accessible only from Teams Admin Center. This article summarizes the admin resources for managing Microsoft 365 Copilot extensions. 

## Manage published apps

Copilot extensions that are [published](./publish.md) to your organization or to the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace are centrally managed from the **Integrated Apps** section of Microsoft Admin Center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com))

To learn more about managing published Copilot extensions, see [Manage extensions for Copilot in Integrated Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps?view=o365-worldwide&context=%2Fmicrosoft-365-copilot%2Fextensibility%2Fcontext)
