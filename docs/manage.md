# Manage extensions for Copilot for Microsoft 365

This article describes the different types of admin controls for managing Copilot extensions. Extensions for Microsoft 365 Copilot are packaged, distributed, and managed in the same way as other apps that run across the integrated Microsoft 365 platform. At its core, the integrated Microsoft 365 app platform extends the Teams app platform to provide a [unified app model](extensions-are-apps.md) for extensibility within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. App management controls for Microsoft 365 are also converging to the centralized Microsoft admin center. However, some controls are still accessible only from Teams admin center.

The following table summarizes admin management tools for Copilot extensibility scenarios, according to distribution.

| Method of building Copilot extension | Published to AppSource (Store) | Published to organization | Uploaded for personal use|
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
|[Teams Toolkit](#manage-extensions-built-with-teams-toolkit) | Microsoft admin center | Teams admin center, Microsoft admin center| Teams admin center|
|[Copilot Studio](#manage-extensions-built-with-copilot-studio)| Microsoft admin center| Power Platform admin center, Microsoft admin center | Power Platform admin center|

## Manage extensions published to AppSource

Copilot extensions that are published to the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace (AppSource) and acquired from the in-product store are centrally managed from the **Integrated Apps** section of **Microsoft admin center** ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)). This is the case regardless of how the extension was builtâ€”with Copilot Studio, Teams Toolkit, or another IDE.

*Global Admin* and *Azure Application Admin* roles can deploy and uninstall apps, manage which apps are available to which users, and block apps from publish in Microsoft admin center.

To learn more about managing published Copilot extensions, see [Manage extensions for Copilot in Microsoft admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context).

## Manage extensions built with Teams Toolkit and other IDEs

Line-of-business apps for Microsoft 365, including Copilot extensions, that are published to your organization or for personal use are called **Custom apps**. Admins control who in your tenant can upload custom apps (either for publishing to the organization, or for personal use) from Teams admin center. Settings to allow the upload and use of custom apps are *only available* in Teams admin center. 

To allow non-admin users in a tenant to submit custom apps to their organization or upload for personal use, the following setting must be enabled. From Teams admin center, select Teams apps > Setup policies > **Global (Org-wide default)** and enable **Upload custom apps**:

To allow users in an organization to interact with custom apps, the following settings must be enabled. From Teams admin center, select Teams apps > Manage apps > Actions (dropdown control) > **Org-wide app settings**. Scroll to the **Custom apps** section and enable the following toggles as needed:

:::image type="content" source="./assets/images/tac-custom-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Custom apps' settings in Teams admin center with both toggles enabled":::

- **Let users install and use available apps by default**: Custom apps published to the organization are assigned to all users by default.
- **Let users interact with custom apps in preview**: All users are allowed to use custom apps for personal use by default.

For more granular per-user and per-team settings, admins can create [app setup policies for custom apps](/microsoftteams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings#app-setup-policy-settings-for-custom-apps) in Teams admin center. For custom apps published to the organization, per-user access can be centrally managed from Microsoft admin center, as described in the next section.

### Extensions published to your organization

Once published to your organization, custom apps are centrally managed from the [**Integrated Apps**](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context) section of Microsoft admin center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)), just like third-party apps acquired from the store. The only difference is that end-users will see these custom, line-of-business apps and extensions labeled with **Built for your org** in the in-product app store.

Admins can [upload Copilot extensions](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#upload-custom-teams-apps-that-work-on-outlook-and-the-microsoft-365-app), [deploy them to their organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#deploy-a-teams-app-that-works-on-outlook-and-the-microsoft-365-app-via-the-integrated-apps-portal), and assign users from Microsoft admin center. Admins can also approve or block custom apps submitted by other users for publish to the organization. Admins can upload, deploy, and block apps from Teams admin center too, however be aware that the [settings in Teams admin center override](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#what-happens-to-your-settings-on-teams-and-outlook) those made in Microsoft admin center for apps running in Teams. Best practice is to manage Copilot extensions from Microsoft admin center wherever possible.

### Extensions uploaded for personal use

Once packaged as Microsoft 365 apps, Copilot extensions can be uploaded (or *sideloaded*) by non-admins for personal use, such as for testing during the development process. Users can upload and deploy app packages directly from Teams Toolkit (Lifecycle > **Provision**), and also from Teams Toolkit CLI (`teamsapp install`) or Teams client (Apps > Manage your apps > Upload an app > **Upload a custom app**). Users can uninstall an app using Teams Toolkit CLI (`teamsapp uninstall`) or Teams client (from Apps > Manage your apps, select the app and then **Remove**).

Custom apps for personal use are managed by the user. However, admins have the ability to globally disable the ability to upload custom apps for personal use [as described above](#manage-extensions-built-with-teams-toolkit-and-other-ides).

## Manage extensions built with Copilot Studio

Admin must first deploy Copilot Studio app:
