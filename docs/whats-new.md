# What's new in Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility

As a developer, you can extend, enrich, and customize [Microsoft 365 Copilot](/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview) for the unique way your customers work. This article provides the latest information about what's new in Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility.

## October 2024: New and generally available

### Use the Copilot Studio agent builder to build declarative agents

Use the Copilot Studio agent builder to create and customize agents for your specific scenarios. With the agent builder, you can use natural language to describe your agent, or you can build it manually via a rich authoring experience. To learn more, see [Overview of Copilot Studio agent builder](copilot-studio-agent-builder.md).

## September 2024: New and generally available

### Build your own agent

You can build your own agents to focus on your specific use cases. Provide custom instructions to tailor responses, ground agents in your organization's data, and add more skills with actions.

You can build agents in two ways:
- [Build delcarative agents](overview-declarative-agent.md) by using the Microsoft 365 Copilot orchestrator and foundation models. You can use Visual Studio Code or the Copilot Studio agent builder.
- [Build custom engine agents](overview-custom-engine-agent.md) with your custom orchestrator and foundation models by using Azure AI Studio and Visual Studio Code.

## August 2024: New in public preview

### Build your own agent and publish it as a Copilot extension

When you build your own agents, you have deeper control over the user experience. Focus responses on custom instructions, ground them in your files, and add more skills with actions. With your own agents, you can extend Copilot responses with in-context handoffs or focus the experience for your use case.

- Use Copilot's orchestrator and foundation models: build a declarative agent from Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Copilot Studio or from the Admin Center under Search & Intelligence. For details, see [Declarative agents overview](overview-declarative-agent.md).
- Use your custom orchestrator and foundation models: build a custom engine agent from Azure AI Studio and Visual Studio Code. For details, see [Custom engine agents overview](overview-custom-engine-agent.md).

### Build skills with API plugins

Connect your APIs as plugins to Microsoft Copilot from Visual Studio Code or Microsoft Copilot Studio. For details, see [API plugins overview](overview-api-plugins.md).
