What's new in Copilot for Microsoft 365

As a developer, you can extend, enrich, and customize [Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview) for the unique way your customers work.

## May 2024: new in private preview

### Build your own copilot and publish it as a Copilot extension

When you build your own copilots, you have deeper control over the user experience. Focus responses on custom instructions, ground them in your files, and plug additional skills with actions. With your own copilots, you can extend Copilot responses with in-context handoffs or focus the experience for your use case.

- Use Copilot's orchestrator and foundation models: build a declarative copilot from Visual Studio Code or Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Use your custom orchestrator and foundation models: build a custom engine copilot from Azure AI Studio and Visual Studio Code.

### Build skills with plugins

Copilot extensions allow you to customize Copilot with tailored experiences that can work with external data, while adding unique skills to accelerate the things your users do every day.

- API plugins: Connect your APIs as plugins to Microsoft Copilot from Visual Studio Code or Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Flow plugins: Use Microsoft Copilot Studio to create plugins that map to existing flows or processes in your organization.
- Connector AI plugins: Use Microsoft Copilot Studio to create plugins for existing data sources using out of the box or custom connectors.
- Prompt plugins: Use Microsoft Copilot Studio to build custom actions grounded on your data in DataVerse.
