# What's new in Microsoft 365 Copilot

As a developer, you can extend, enrich, and customize [Microsoft 365 Copilot](/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview) for the unique way your customers work. In this article, we cover what's new related to Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility.

## August 2024: New in public preview

### Build your own agent and publish it as a Copilot extension

When you build your own agents, you have deeper control over the user experience. Focus responses on custom instructions, ground them in your files, and add more skills with actions. With your own agents, you can extend Copilot responses with in-context handoffs or focus the experience for your use case.

- Use Copilot's orchestrator and foundation models: build a declarative agent from Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Copilot Studio or from the Admin Center under Search & Intelligence. For details, see [Declarative agents overview](overview-declarative-agent.md).
- Use your custom orchestrator and foundation models: build a custom engine agent from Azure AI Studio and Visual Studio Code. For details, see [Custom engine agents overview](overview-custom-engine-agent.md).

### Build skills with API plugins

Connect your APIs as plugins to Microsoft Copilot from Visual Studio Code or Microsoft Copilot Studio. For details, see [API plugins overview](overview-api-plugins.md).
