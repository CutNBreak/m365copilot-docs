### Build your own copilot and publish it as a Copilot extension

When you build your own copilots, you have deeper control over the user experience. Focus responses on custom instructions, ground them in your files, and plug additional skills with actions. With your own copilots, you can extend Copilot responses with in-context handoffs or focus the experience for your use case.

- Use Copilot's orchestrator and foundation models: build a declarative copilot from Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Copilot Studio or from the Admin Center under Search & Intelligence. For details, see [Declarative copilots overview](overview-declarative-copilot.md).
- Use your custom orchestrator and foundation models: build a custom engine copilot from Azure AI Studio and Visual Studio Code. For details, see [Custom engine copilots overview](overview-custom-engine-copilot.md).

### Build skills with API plugins

Connect your APIs as plugins to Microsoft Copilot from Visual Studio Code or Microsoft Copilot Studio. For details, see [API plugins overview](overview-api-plugins.md).
