# Your extensibility options for Microsoft 365 Copilot

When it comes to deciding on your approach to AI development, there are numerous options to consider. Microsoft offers [Azure AI solutions](/azure/developer/intro/azure-ai-for-developers) and Microsoft Copilot extensibility options. 
This guide aims to streamline your journey through the options for Microsoft 365, assisting you in identifying the most suitable solution aligned with your specific needs and goals.

## Extend Copilot or build a custom engine copilot?

When you're looking to create a fully customized end-to-end AI product to cater to your business needs, you typically choose language models and orchestration for your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions.

On the other hand, you can extend Microsoft Copilot, which is powered by private instances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Azure OpenAI service. Copilot combines LLM responses with organizational context to provide relevant assistance. When you build extensions for Copilot, you can utilize the [orchestration layer](orchestrator.md) representing the interface between foundation LLMs, to select and execute the right content from the right plugin.

Here's your first decision-making point; extending Copilot to leverage the model and orchestrator, or build with your choice?

**You probably want to extend Microsoft Copilot if any of the following is true:**
- You want to build a service on top of Microsoft Copilot
- You have a REST API (so that you can plug it into your Copilot plugin)
- You have prior experience in building a Teams message extension (so that you can just update it as a Copilot plugin)

**You probably want to build a custom engine copilot if any of the following is true:**
- You want to use a particular model, an LLM or small language model (SLM), for your service
- You want your service to be independent from Microsoft Copilot, accessible to all Microsoft 365 users, regardless of your Copilot licensing status 
- You have prior experience in building a Teams bot, or are familiar with Teams bot development (so you can quickly get started with Teams AI Library to build a custom engine copilot)

### Pick your option

- ðŸŽ¯ If you want to **extend Microsoft Copilot**, go to the next section, [Option 1](#option-1-extending-microsoft-copilot)!

### Types of copilot extensibility for Microsoft 365

Now, itâ€™s important to understand the variety of methods available for applying the capabilities of external services, apps, and data.

From an end-user perspective, Microsoft Copilot offers two distinct extension interfaces: standalone plugins and declarative copilots. Standalone plugins connect REST APIs directly within the context of your tasks, while declarative copilots function like apps. Think of Microsoft Copilot as an operating system, where plugins act as services, and declarative copilots serve as applications.

Now, let's find out which extensibility options are for youâ€”

To customize Microsoft Copilot to create a specific copilot for particular tasks and domain knowledge, build:

#### Declarative copilots

ðŸŽ¯ [**Declarative copilots**](overview-declarative-copilot.md) are designed to enhance the user experience by allowing the creation of personalized chat experiences to provide tailored interactions and responses, with a similar look-and-feel with Microsoft Copilot interface.

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/declarative-copilot-ui.png" alt-text="A fictional declarative copilot UI." lightbox="assets/images/declarative-copilot-ui.png" border="false":::

When & why to use Declarative copilots:

- Scenario that requires â€‹focus or specialization
- Layer on top of the full capability â€‹of Microsoft 365 Copilotâ€‹
- Target specific roles or areas â€‹in organization, such as HR, Sales, and Finance
- Scope to specific data sources including domain knowledgeâ€‹
- Custom instructions to enable nuanced interpretation of data received from sources like pluginsâ€‹

And you can connect your declarative copilots with connectors and plugins.

#### Microsoft Graph connectors

ðŸŽ¯ [**Graph connectors**](overview-graph-connector.md) enable data ingestion from various sources to Microsoft Graph, facilitating unified data access and insights across Microsoft 365 and other services. They can work either standalone, or with declarative copilots.

> [!NOTE]
> Connectors can be built as a stand-alone, or with a declarative copilot.

#### Plugins

**Plugins** add skills and actions to Microsoft 365. Plugins have a few different types that are built differently.
And there are the growing number of extensions you build. Your options include:

- ðŸŽ¯ [**API plugins**](overview-api-plugins.md) can work either standalone, or with declarative copilots by calling REST APIs via OpenAPI service.
- ðŸŽ¯ [**Teams Message Extensions**](overview-message-extension-bot.md) for Teams are the search and action capability for Teams that now work as plugins too.
- ðŸŽ¯ [**Actions in Copilot Studio**](/microsoft-copilot-studio/copilot-plugins-overview?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context), which connects Microsoft 365 and the Power Platform environment. Actions include **Conversational actions**, **Prompts**, **Flows**, and **Connectors**. If you prefer developing without much coding, these options are for you.

> [!NOTE]
> Plugins can be built as a stand-alone, or with a declarative copilot.

> [!TIP]
> If you've built message extensions for Teams before, you can immediately see the value of Copilot extensibility, but if you want to build the latest and greatest, try building API plugins and Graph Connectors!

### Tool options: Pro-code or low-code?

Your journey vary based on your desired outcomes and your coding expertise. Whether you're a seasoned coder or prefer low-code or no-code solutions, thereâ€™s a suite of tools tailored to your development style.

How you build and which tools you should use is up to you. Your choices are:

- ðŸŽ¯ **Pro-code** options are declarative copilots, API plugins, message extensions, and Graph connectors. [**Teams Toolkit**](/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals) for [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) would be your best friend for the development to tailor your copilots.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Low-code** or **no-code** options are declarative copilots, all Copilot Studio actions, and Graph connectors as knowledge source. You can develop rapidly with user-friendly interface on [**Copilot Studio**](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio).

### How does it differ from Copilot extensions for Microsoft 365?

In the context of building copilots for Microsoft 365, there are several options available. This diagram provides a comparison between the **extensions** (Graph connectors, plugins, and declarative copilots, which can connect to Graph connectors and plugins) and the **custom engine copilot**:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/copilot-ext-vs-cec.png" border="true" alt-text="This diagram compares options between Copilot extensions and custom engine copilots for M365" lightbox="assets/images/copilot-ext-vs-cec.png":::

The custom engine copilots operate on a BYO (Bring Your Own) model. So, your copilot is independent from Microsoft Copilot and its LLM and orchestrator.

ðŸŽ¯ Learn more on building your own [**custom engine copilots**](overview-custom-engine-copilot.md).

### Tool options: Pro-code or low-code?

How you build and which tools you should use is up to you. Your choices are:

- ðŸŽ¯ **Pro-code**: If you prefer coding for full customization, develop one with [**Teams Toolkit**](/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals) for [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension). You can start with either:
  - [**Teams AI Library**](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/teams%20conversational%20ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview) to code, or
  - [**Azure OpenAI Studio**](https://oai.azure.com/) to configure then export the generated code to Teams Toolkit to deploy to Teams!

- ðŸŽ¯ **Low-code** or **no-code**: You can develop rapidly with user-friendly interface on [**Copilot Studio**](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio) to build Copilot Studio custom copilots.
