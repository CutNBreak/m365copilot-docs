## Extend Copilot or build a custom engine copilot?

When you're looking to create a fully customized end-to-end AI product to cater to your business needs, you typically choose language models and orchestration for your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions.

On the other hand, you can extend Microsoft Copilot, which is powered by private instances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Azure OpenAI service. Copilot combines LLM responses with organizational context to provide relevant assistance. When you build extensions for Copilot, you can utilize the [orchestration layer](orchestrator.md) representing the interface between foundation LLMs, to select and execute the right content from the right plugin.

Here's your first decision-making point; extending Copilot to leverage the orchestrator, or build with your own?

### Types of copilot extensibility for Microsoft 365

Now, itâ€™s important to understand the variety of methods available for applying the capabilities of external services, apps, and data.

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/ILPOhVz9OdI]

There are two distinct extension interfaces for Microsoft Copilot for end-users: standalone plugins that connect REST APIs, and declarative copilots. As an analogy, you can view Microsoft Copilot as something like an operating system, where plugins are services, and declarative copilots are apps.

Now, let's find out which extensibility option(s) are for youâ€”

To create a copilot for specific tasks and domain knowledge, build:

- ðŸŽ¯ [**Declarative copilots**](overview-declarative-copilot.md)

To add unstructured data into Microsoft Graph, use:

- ðŸŽ¯ [**Graph connectors**](overview-graph-connector.md), which enable data ingestion from various sources to Microsoft Graph, facilitating unified data access and insights across Microsoft 365 and other services

And there are the growing number of extensions you build. Your options include:

- **Plugins**, which add skills and actions to Microsoft 365.
  - ðŸŽ¯ [**API plugins**](overview-api-plugins.md) can work either standalone, or with declarative copilots by calling REST APIs via OpenAPI service.
  - ðŸŽ¯ [**Message Extensions**](overview-message-extension-bot.md) for Teams are the search and action capability for Teams that now work as plugins too.
  - ðŸŽ¯ [**Actions in Copilot Studio**](/microsoft-copilot-studio/copilot-plugins-overview?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context), which connects Microsoft 365 and the Power Platform environment.
    - **Conversational actions**, which can be created directly in Copilot Studio, to process a user query by completing one or more operations, and then sends one or more responses back to the user.
    - **Prompts** which use AI Builder and natural language understanding including grounding on Dataverse to target the specific scenarios and workflows within your business.
    - **Flows**, which use Power Automate flow to map existing flows or processes in your organization to perform actions, and retrieve and work with data.
    - **Connectors**, which use Power Platform connectors to access data from other systems, such as popular enterprise products like Salesforce, Zendesk, MailChimp, and GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> Connectors and plugins can be built as a stand-alone, or with a declarative copilot.

> [!TIP]
> If you've built message extensions for Teams before, you can immediately see the value of Copilot extensibility, but if you want to build the latest and greatest, try building API plugins and Graph Connectors!

### Tool options: Pro-code or low-code?

Your journey vary based on your desired outcomes and your coding expertise. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned coder or prefer low-code or no-code solutions, thereâ€™s a suite of tools tailored to your development style.

How you build and which tools you should use is up to you. Your choices are:

- ðŸŽ¯ **Pro-code** options are declarative copilots, API plugins, message extensions, and Graph connectors. [**Teams Toolkit**](/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals) for [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) would be your best friend for the development to tailor your copilots.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Low-code** or **no-code** options are declarative copilots, all Copilot Studio actions, and Graph connectors. You can develop rapidly with user-friendly interface on [**Copilot Studio**](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio).

| **Declarative copilots**     | Your own branded chat experience <br/> <br/> Improved discoverability and user-experiences   | Still in private preview and features are limited  |
| **API plugins**                  | Support search and action <br/> <br/> Support basic Adaptive Cards for better UX <br/> <br/> Simpler development with existing REST APIs with OpenAPI specifications <br/><br/> You can include instructions to LLM    | Still in private preview and features are limited       |
| **Teams message extensions** | Discoverable through Teams Store or App Source marketplace <br/> <br/> Support search and action <br/> <br/> Support Adaptive Cards for better UX and more controls <br/><br/> Works on Outlook too <br/> <br/> If you previously have build message extensions for Teams, they now work as plugins         | Max 1 million plugins enabled per user <br/> <br/> Limited numbers of commands (max 3) and parameters (max 5) <br/> <br/> Orchestrator only reasons with 10 plugins per prompt <br/> <br/> Data can leave compliance boundary, as it calls the bot framework command, which is hosted externally to the Microsoft 365 boundary<br/> <br/> Performance depends on developers and hosting<br/> <br/> Handling multi-parameters with complex prompts can be challenging |
| **Copilot Studio plugins**   | Fastest to first run experience <br/> <br/> No infrastructure management is needed <br/> <br/> No coding experience required <br/> <br/> Copilot Studio is included as part of the Microsoft Copilot license            | Customization can be limited <br/> <br/> Scaling might be limited to Microsoft Copilot Studio subscription tiers <br/> <br/> If the plugin uses Power Platform Connectors, users require a Power Platform license           |

#### Data types

Consider your data: how it's structured, the level of volume and activity you expect, and the required data access.

| Solution | Data structure | Data volume | Data activity | Summarize/ Act |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Graph connectors** | Unstructured data (*e.g.* plain text documents, wiki pages, and PDF files) | Up to 5M items per connection | Up to 20 requests per second | Summarize (Copilot analyzes and extracts key information) only |
| **Message extension plugins** | Structured data (organized in a predefined manner, often in the form of tables with rows and columns)| Suitable for high volume data (Over 5M) | Suitable for high activity (Over 20 req/sec.)  | Summarize + Act (with Adaptive Card, a user can modify the data)|
| **Copilot Studio plugins** | Structured data | Suitable for high volume data (Over 5M) | Suitable for high volume data (Over 5M) | Summarize only |

**Coming soon**: Soon, Copilot will analyze input prompts using machine learning techniques to generate new content. It examines available plugin commands based on their descriptions and parameters. Then, it populates relevant data into those parameters and executes the command.

## Option 2: Building a custom engine copilot for Microsoft 365

With Azure AI services, you can craft a custom AI chatbot for Teams and Microsoft 365 applications. If youâ€™re seeking a custom bot solution that operates on Teams chat, then building with the Teams AI Library is the perfect fit for you.

:::image type="content" source="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/assets/images/bots/teams-ai-library.png" alt-text="A diagram that explains how a custom engine copilot agent in Teams work" lightbox="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/assets/images/bots/teams-ai-library.png" border="false":::

### How does it differ from Copilot extensions for Microsoft 365?

In the context of building copilots for Microsoft 365, there are several options available. This diagram provides a comparison between the **Copilot extensibility** options (Graph connectors, plugins, and declarative copilots, which can connect to Graph connectors and plugins) and the **custom engine copilot**:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/copilot-ext-vs-cec.png" border="true" alt-text="This diagram compares options between Copilot extensions and custom engine copilot for M365" lightbox="assets/images/copilot-ext-vs-cec.png":::

The custom engine Copilot operates on a BYO (Bring Your Own) model. So, you use your preferred LLM and orchestrator instead of Microsoft Copilot services.

Building custom engine copilot with **Teams AI Library** is an excellent choice if:

- You want to choose models and orchestration
- You have prior experience in building Teams bots or are familiar with Teams bot development
- You aim to have your conversational AI bot accessible to all Microsoft 365 users, regardless of their Copilot licensing status
