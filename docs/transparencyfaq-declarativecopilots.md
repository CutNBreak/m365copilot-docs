# Declarative Copilots FAQ

## What are Declarative copilots?  
Declarative copilots are customized versions of M365 Copilot that enable customers to create personalized experiences that run in M365 Copilot. This feature builds on top of the Copilot for M365 system. It allows users to build custom Declarative copilots with capabilities, instructions on their purpose and behavior, and the option to access enterprise knowledge (including SharePoint and Graph Connectors) to reference.

## How were Declarative copilots evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?  
All response generation features of copilots are tested, measured and validated internally before releasing generally. Such evaluations are done using extensive experimentation to ensure accurate, grounded and responsible responses that align with human preferences. 

For each capability that is supported in Declarative copilots, we have conducted several tests to validate Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. In addition to all Copilot for Microsoft 365 related capabilities, Responsible AI (RAI) testing was performed on different harm types to evaluate defect rates. The defect scores are then used to improve the model and mitigate the harm. It’s important to keep in mind that the system was designed to mimic natural human communication, but the output may be inaccurate, incorrect, or out of date. 

## What are the limitations of Declarative copilots? How can users minimize the impact of Declarative copilot's limitations when using the system?  
In Copilot Studio, Declarative copilots are only supported for use in English for public preview. 

For end users, there are user disclaimers with terms and privacy commitments on Declarative copilot's homepage. For line-of-business developers and IT admins, Microsoft Admin Center is where to manage Copilot extensibility solutions.
