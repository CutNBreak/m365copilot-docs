# Custom engine agents user experience

Microsoft 365 Copilot is the user interface for AI. Custom engine agents are sophisticated conversational bots designed to harness the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for seamless user interaction. Agents act as automated helpers that users interact with to perform tasks grounded in organizational data.

The agent user experience (UX) provides intuitive, efficient, and contextually relevant interactions to enhance user satisfaction and productivity. This article describes the UX features and best practices that you can apply to user interactions in your custom engine agents.

## Zero prompt

Zero prompt, also known as a conversation starter, is an agent feature that provides predefined prompts in a chat session to help users initiate interactions.

## Suggested promptsâ€‹

Suggested prompts are designed to guide users to the next best actions based on the conversation context, user profiles, and organizational preferences. These prompts replace the existing functionality of dynamic suggested actions and can also be displayed within Adaptive Card responses.

## Streaming responses (preview)

Streaming responses are designed to enhance the user experience by providing visual real-time updates as the agent processes a request. This  helps to prevent noticeable delays and makes interactions feel faster and more engaging.

You can implement streaming responses by using the Teams AI library. For more information, see [Streaming messages](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/streaming-ux?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context).

## Citations (preview)

Citations are references to the sources of information used by the agent to generate its responses. These citations help to ensure transparency, credibility, and trustworthiness in agent interactions.

## AI labels and sensitivity labels

AI labels indicate that a response is generated by AI. This transparency helps users distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated content and fosters trust in agent responses. These labels are automatically added to AI-generated messages when you use the Teams AI library.

Sensitivity labels mark responses or content that contains confidential or sensitive information. This helps maintain proper data handling and helps to ensure that sensitive information is protected. Labels can be customized to reflect different levels of confidentiality, such as Confidential or Highly Confidential, and are important for compliance and security.

## Feedback loop (preview)

Feedback loops are mechanisms that allow users to provide feedback on an agent's responses. This feedback helps refine and improve the agent's performance over time to help it become more accurate and useful.
