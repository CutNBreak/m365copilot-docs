# How Copilot for Microsoft 365 decides which plugin to use

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is your personal assistant for work. It helps with various general **tasks**, such as writing, summarizing, researching, and more. Copilot has different **skills** that correspond to these different types of tasks. For example, Copilot can summarize action items from a meeting, suggest edits to a file, or track down resources and experts on a given topic within your organization. Each skill has its own parameters and outputs that are tailored to the specific task.

Like any copilot, Copilot for Microsoft 365 is trained with data at a point in time. To retrieve and process new and real-time information, especially data that's specific to your organization and workflows, Copilot requires *plugins*. **Plugins** extend Copilot for Microsoft 365's skills and utility for end users, enabling it to choose the right skill from thousands.

But how does Copilot know which skill to use when you ask for help? How does it interpret your request and match it to the best skill available? That's the job of the Copilot for Microsoft 365 **orchestrator**.

This article will explain the logic behind Copilot's skill selection process and how you can ensure Copilot employs your plugin at every opportunity it can benefit your users.

## The Copilot orchestrator

Between the end-user's natural language input to Copilot's natural language output, the Microsoft Copilot orchestrator works behind the scenes to select and execute the right skill(s) from the right plugin(s) for the end-user's given task.

The orchestration layer represents the interface between foundation LLMs and the many ways you can extend, enrich, and customize Copilot for the way your customers work.

The following chart illustrates how the Copilot for Microsoft 365 orchestrator selects the right plugin, with the right skill, at the right time, even when there are thousands of options to choose from.

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/orchestrator-sequence.png" alt-text="Visual illustration of the sequential steps in the text following this image.":::

1. **Natural language input**

    The user types a prompt to Copilot through Microsoft 365 chat.

2. **Search for relevant tools**

    The Copilot orchestrator searches its tool catalog of installed and enabled plugins for an initial list of relevant skills.

3. **Reasoning**

    Copilot draws upon the combined knowledge of its LLM and your organizational data from Microsoft Graph to analyze the request and determine the context of the user. It then breaks down the user's prompt into intents, or goals. Each goal is then broken into tasks.

4. **Mapping user's intent to slots**

    The orchestrator maps the user's tasks to plugin skills and/or built-in Copilot skill functions, mapping implicit constraints from the user's prompt to the slots (parameter values) required to execute each of the identified skills.

5. **Execute tool**

    Copilot and its plugins are called to execute their selected skills.

6. **Generate summary**

    Copilot merges, filters, or ranks the responses from different assistants, and generates a single response for the user.

7. **Natural language output**

    Finally, Copilot delivers the response to the user and updates the conversation state. Copilot is ready for its next prompt.

If you imagine a user's prompt to Copilot like a construction project, then the Copilot orchestrator is the *general contractor*, who coordinates and organizes the work of the specialist *subcontractors*, your plugins. Similar to a general contractor, the orchestrator is responsible for ensuring the project is "completed" according to specifications implied by the user's  input (in other words, that Copilot's response satisfies the user's intent in their request).

However, its the responsibility of each plugin to provide Copilot with an accurate description of its skills and to execute its skills effectively. This will instill a sense of trust in your users and ensure Copilot will call your plugin each time its skills are needed. The next section provides more details on how to optimize your plugin for the orchestrator to find and use.

## Plugin search optimization

Copilot for Microsoft 365 can uniquely choose the right skill from thousands. But how can you make sure Copilot will choose *your plugin* to provide the right skill?

The answer lies in how you describe your plugin, its skills, and the parameters for skill execution. Specifying concise and accurate descriptions in your plugin manifest is critical to ensuring Copilot knows when and how to invoke your plugin.

The following sections provide guidance and examples for plugins, skills, and parameter descriptions.

### Plugin descriptions

Plugin descriptions should include the user actions, the types of input, and the types of output, for which your plugin is intended.

Long and short app descriptions in the app manifest must clearly define the scope of your app. To render an app as a plugin in Copilot, app description must be modified to suit the following plugin requirements:

- App long description must clearly explain how users can use a message extension plugin in Copilot and what functionality they can expect. For example, Use Contoso cloud in Copilot to search and summarize your tasks.
- Short description must briefly describe the app's functionality in a natural language and can include name of the app.

The following table lists the short description examples for various plugin scenarios:

#### [Tasks](#tab/tasks)

### Skill descriptions

Skill descriptions are used to interpret the user's prompt into an intent and then map that to the most relevant skill available to Copilot. Include which action the skill handles, and also the expected format of input and description of the output.

Currently Teams message extension plugin support is limited to search commands, with support for action commands coming soon.

Search skill descriptions should:

- Focus on what and how the command searches (detailed list) in natural language.
- Include verbs and synonyms, if applicable.
- Focus on keywords that are likely to be used in the search function of your native apps.

The following table lists search command examples for various plugin scenarios:

          "title": "Tasks",
          "description": "Search for high priority tasks related to Northwind that are due tomorrow.",
          "initialRun": true,
          "fetchTask": false,
          "context": [

### Parameter descriptions

A good parameter description explains what the parameter is, not what the parameter does, and the expected format.

When used directly in Microsoft Teams chat and Outlook mail compose, you can use a message extension to query one parameter at a time. When used as a plugin, message extension search commands support up to five parameters (one parameter must be visible in the message extension search bar). A parameter must have a good description, which should describe the expected input, including format or type.

The following are few examples on basic and advances search requests for various plugin scenarios:
